# Analysis-of-GDP-and-Population-Data

GDP stands for "Gross Domestic Product" and represents the total monetary value of all final goods and services produced (and sold on the market) within a country during a period of time (typically 1 year). GDP is the most commonly used measure of economic activity. Population data is defined as a set of individuals who share a characteristic or set of these. A population is mainly determined by geographies, such as all people in California, or all people in the United States. Demographers (people who study human populations) categorize this as the natural population.
Two types of data was available i.e. GDP and Population from 1960 to 2020. Analysis is done using plotly plots to study the important results and conclusions behind the data.
